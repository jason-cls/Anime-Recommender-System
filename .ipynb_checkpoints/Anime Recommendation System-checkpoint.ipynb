    "Unlike the offline evaluation of traditional machine learning algorithms, data cannot be separated into independent training and testing sets. This is because recommenders typically need to have knowledge of a user during training to make recommendations for them during testing. The same holds true for items which can be recommended. Due to this, all users and items must be included during training and testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create the testing set, we will use all of the user rating data as is. The training set however will consist of a proportion of user ratings randomly masked (removed). If the rating data was timestamped, we could mask the ratings input after a certain date instead of randomly. The goal of a RecSys then is to recommend the masked ratings as good recommendations for a user. A validation set can be created by doing the same to the training set."

    "Recommender systems (RecSys) are typically grouped into two main categories: **content-based filtering**, and **collaborative filtering**. Content-based filtering RecSys aim to provide recommendations to a user based on the items that user has already interacted with. If a user has highly rated an item in the past, the content-based filtering will learn that user's preferences and recommend items matching the user's preferences and past interactions. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we will need to encode items in a feature space. A user must also be able to be represented in this same feature space in order to capture his/her item preferences. A similarity measure could then be used to capture how relevant any item is to a user for personalized recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any model, it has advantages and disadvantages:\n",
    "- **Advantages**\n",
    "    - Does not require data of other users to make recommendations.\n",
    "    - Good at capturing a user's niche item interests few people have interest in.\n",
    "- **Disadvantages**\n",
    "    - Lack of variety - the model will always recommend items similar to what the user has past interaction with, and will never recommend different types of items the user does not know about, but may like.\n",
    "    - Model performance is heavily dependent on good feature engineering in order to represent items and users in the same feature space. Domain knowledge is often essential."

    "Recommender systems using collaborative filtering (CF) focus on making recommendations for a user based on other users' item interactions. Unlike content-based filtering, CF is capable of recommending items the user would like, but would have never considered. Additionally, this family of recsys is not reliant on feature engineering to make good recommendations.\n",

    "- **Disadvantages**\n",
    "    - Suffers from the cold-start problem - a new item cannot be recommended if it has not been seen during training. Heuristics need to be used to generate recommendations in this case.\n",

A nearest neighbours approach is taken to then predict the ratings of items the target user has not yet interacted with. \n",
    "    - **Item-based CF**: Assumes that items having same rating patterns by a group of users are good to recommend together since they are similar. New recommendations are thus made based on their similarity with highly rated items the user has interacted with in the past. <br> <br>\n",
